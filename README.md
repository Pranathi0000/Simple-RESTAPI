# Simple-RESTAPI
Simple RESTful Service using Spring Boot
Description
This project is a simple RESTful service developed using Spring Boot, providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a collection of resources. It offers endpoints to interact with these resources via HTTP requests, following REST principles.

Features
REST Endpoints: Provides HTTP endpoints for performing CRUD operations on resources.
Data Handling: Manages resources (e.g., users, products, tasks) in a structured manner.
Spring Boot: Utilizes Spring Boot for easy setup, dependency management, and rapid development of RESTful services.
JSON Format: Communicates with clients using JSON format for data exchange.
Functionality
Create Resource: Allows the creation of new resources using POST requests.
Read Resource: Retrieves resource details using GET requests.
Update Resource: Modifies existing resources using PUT or PATCH requests.
Delete Resource: Deletes resources using DELETE requests.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building and deploying Java-based applications.
Spring Web: Module for building web applications, including RESTful services.
Java: Core programming language for the service implementation.
JSON: Data interchange format for communication between client and server.
How to Use
Run Application: Start the Spring Boot application.
Interact via API: Use tools like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the specified endpoints.
Retrieve/Manipulate Resources: Access the appropriate endpoints to manage resources as per CRUD operations.
Purpose
The project demonstrates the development of a basic RESTful service using Spring Boot, showcasing the implementation of REST endpoints for interacting with resources via HTTP methods.

Notes
This project serves as a simple example to understand the creation of RESTful services using Spring Boot and does not cover advanced topics like security, database integration, or extensive validation.
